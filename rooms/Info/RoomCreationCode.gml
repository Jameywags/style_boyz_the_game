It all started one day when Jamey was bored and wanted a new hobby. 
He did some research on game making and decided it would be fun to try.
Jamey, Luke, and Himat had recently hung out so this silly idea was born.
Jamey started this game alone and no one but Kelsey knew about it.
After the initial ground work was layed he realized he needed some
coding help so he brought Luke onto the team. Although Luke didn't
know anything about game coding, he was very quick to solve almost
any coding snafu Jamey found himself in. Using the user friendly
program 'Gamemaker Studio 2', they worked for the past month to create
this simple platformer. The initial hard work is now done. Player
control, collisions with objects, unique player abilities, and menus.
Graphics were taken from a tutorial because art is hard. However new
graphics are in the process of creation by a much more tallented artist
than either Jamey, or Luke. The end goal for this game is to have
multiple unique levels with special boss fights at the end. It wont be
perfect. It will take time. There will be bugs. But with some hard work
eventually it will be amazing!

We hope you enjoy the game cause we sure enjoy making it. 
Thank you. :)
